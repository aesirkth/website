  Ã†SIR is not only an engineering association - it is also a place to hang out with other like-minded rocketry-interested students. 

  We welcome everyone to join us just to hang out and learn, not just those with experience in rocketry or engineering. 
  Our members are from all levels of education, so there'll be opportunities to make friends from all over campus.
