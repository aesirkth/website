Ã†SIR was created to provide a forum for students with an interest in rocketry, where they can develop their passion and knowledge in practical aerospace projects. Our goal is to educate students in rocketry and engineering and give our members real world engineering experience. The activities of the association will further strengthen the position of KTH as one of the leading Aerospace Universities.

Our mission is to become one of the top student organisations for rocket building in the world, by breaking and holding the student rocketry altitude record in Europe (which is currently above 30 kilometers). Ultimately, we intend to reach altitudes beyond the 120 kilometer mark.
