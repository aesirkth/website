  We are currently preparing for the first launch of Odin in late October 2018, follow us on Instagram or Facebook for more frequent updates!

  Odin will be our first sounding rocket, with a thrust of about 3kN. Just like the norse god Odin gave an eye for wisdom, our rocket Odin will give us valuable knowledge on constructing rockets.
  So far, we have conducted two static firings of our rocket motor and are preparing a third test.
