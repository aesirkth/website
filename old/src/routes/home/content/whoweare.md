Ã†SIR is a student rocketry association based at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.
We consist of about 30 students, spread over several programmes and degrees - including Engineering Physics, Electrical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering.

The association is focused on rocketry, but is more than just a place where rockets are built. It's a meeting place for people from all over the world with interest in rocketry, where our members get to experience first-hand how technical and cultural differences may affect large international projects.
