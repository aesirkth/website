Project Vidar was initiated during the fall of 2017 as a collaboration with CNES, the French government space agency, as a part of their PERSEUS project.
The project was to construct a payload to fly on their SERA4 rocket from Esrange in Kiruna, Sweden.

We developed and built a payload capable of measuring vibrations during the rocket launch, which was presented during a seminar in Paris in the spring of 2018.
Due to issues with the rocket, the launch was postponed twice.
It is currently planned for late 2020.
