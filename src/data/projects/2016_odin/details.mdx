Project Odin began in 2016 as the first project of ÆSIR. With the support of KTH Space Center and KTH Opportunities fund,
the project formed the association.

After a 2-year development and testing processes,
the 4-day launch campaign of the Odin rocket launch began on the 29th of October 2018 at FMV Älvdalens Skjutfält in Älvdalen, Sweden.
12 members of the association participated in the final on-site preparations.

On the **31st of October 2018, at 12:05**, our first rocket was successfully launched!

Preparations, fueling and ignition went perfect and the rocket soared off into the sky.
Due to a low cloud base, 300 meters from the ground, visual contact was lost quickly after liftoff. At 12:09 radio tracking began, but unfortunately no signal was ever found.
A search party was carried during 2 days in the most likely impact areas, with and with parachute deployment. But the Odin rocket has not yet been recovered.
The Odin rocket was 250 cm tall, 8 cm in diameter and weighed 8 kg. It had a total thrust of 1.5 kN and could reach an altitude of 2.5 km.
