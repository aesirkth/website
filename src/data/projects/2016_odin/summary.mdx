Project Odin began in 2016 as the first project of ÆSIR. With the support of KTH Space Center and KTH Opportunities fund,
the project formed the association. Within the project, we conducted several static firings to learn more about the characteristics of the engine used.

After 2 years of development, learning and testing, the 4-day launch campaign of the Odin rocket launch began on the 29th of October 2018 at FMV Älvdalens Skjutfält in Älvdalen, Sweden.
12 members of the association participated in the final on-site preparations.

On the **31st of October 2018, at 12:05**, our first rocket was successfully launched!
