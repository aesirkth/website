We are always searching for students to join our association.
ÆSIR is supposed to be fun and educational, therefore no previous experiences or skills are required.
On the other hand, ÆSIR was created for those who have an interest in rockets or space and want to perform real-world engineering tasks.
We would also like you to be a team-player. Our project requires students from almost all disciplines and all level of studies at KTH.

In our association we have many different roles with associated responsibilities.
Generally we search for project members and managers, but if you have your own idea and need some help or guidance - we are happy to hear all about it!

ÆSIR was created by students for students to learn. We are always in need of new talent and skills.
If you are interested in joining us, let us know in the form below. We'll contact you in the future.
