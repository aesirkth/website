By supporting Ã†SIR, you get the chance to both get your name out there through logo placement on our rockets and to support a group of students in breaking the European record of altitude for student rocketry.
We gladly accept any kind of support - funding, equipment or knowledge - anything helps our cause.

We are happy and very thankful to receive both named and anonymous donations of any kind, either physical or virtual support.
If you choose to make a swish and if you add your name in the description, we will officially thank you!
Our swish number is: 123 435 72 24
