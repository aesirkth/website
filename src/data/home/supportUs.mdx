By supporting Ã†SIR, you get the chance to both get your name out there through logo placement on our rockets and to support a group of students in breaking the European record of altitude for student rocketry.
We gladly accept any kind of support - funding, equipment or knowledge - anything helps our cause.

## Logo placement

import { Image, Images } from "@components/image";

<Images>
  <Image {...require("@data/home/supportus1.jpg")} caption="Logos on a rocket" />
  <Image {...require("@data/home/supportus2.jpg")} caption="Logos on support equipment" />
</Images>

If you're interested in helping us out, and possibly have your logo visible on our equipment, do not hesitate from reaching out to us!
Our primary point of contact is through [contact@aesir.se](mailto:contact@aesir.se).

## Donations

We are happy, and very thankful, to receive both donations of any kind, either in terms of items or financial support.
If you choose to make a swish and if you add your name in the description, we will officially thank you!

Our Swish number is [1234 35 72 24](tel:+461234357224)
