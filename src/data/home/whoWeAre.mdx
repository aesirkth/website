title: Who we are
---

Ã†SIR is a student rocketry association founded in 2016 at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.
We have around 40 members every year, which are all students at KTH.
Roughly half of us are international students and we cover many disciplines and levels of study, although most of our members study
Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, Vehicle Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Engineering Physics and Mechanical Engineering.

The association is focused on rocketry, but is much more than just a place where rockets are built.
It is a community and meeting place for people with interest in rocketry or space.
Our members also get the chance to experience real-world advanced engineering projects, that can provide them with skills and knowledge which make them stand out from the crowd.
