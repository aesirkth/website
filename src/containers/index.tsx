/**
 * The idea of the home page is to follow a certain flow of information.

 * We first present who we are. This gives us credibility and context for the work and mission to be presented.
 *
 * Next we present our mission. This gives a logical reason for the existance of Ã†SIR, as well as reasonable explanations
 * as to why our projects are what they are.
 *
 * Finally we present our current and past projects. The current projects are meant to invoke interest,
 * while past projects are meant to be means of proving we can do rocket projects.
 *
 * At last, we present actions. Here we want to capture potential new members or supporters to do something.
