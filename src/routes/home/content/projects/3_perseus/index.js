  # PERSEUS
  During fall 2017/spring 2018 some of our members participated in a collaboration with the the French government space agency CNES as a part of their PERSEUS project.
  The project was to construct an experiment to fly on their rocket.
  Our team decided to build a device that would measure the vibrations of the rocket.

  The project was finished on time and the whole team later participated in a seminar in Paris. 
  Unfortunatly the launch planned to be at Esrange in Kiruna, Sweden, was postponed until further notice due to problems with the rocket.
