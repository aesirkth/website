  During the fall of 2017, we started up a model rocketry project.
  The goal is to give our less experienced members, who maybe never been able or gotten a chance to build a model rocket, a leap into what rocket building is all about!

  It is also a perfect start to your rocket building career later proceeding to one of our larger projects, such as Odin. 
  More pictures from our model rocket launches we conducted in April 2017 and December 2017 can be found [on our Facebook Page](https://facebook.com/aesirkth/) or on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/aesirkth/)!
